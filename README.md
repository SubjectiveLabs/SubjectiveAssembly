# Subjective Assembly

Create, manage and host student timetables and school bell times for Subjective: the school-driven, student-centric iOS class and learning organisation app.
Start using Assembly at https://subjective.school or self-host for privacy and security using the open-source Assembly code.

## Self-host Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Use Cargo and Vite to run Assembly front-end locally, or host the code using your own hardware/service. (Docker coming soon.)
3. Configure your school in Assembly and publish.

If your school is public on Subjective Discovery, changes to your school will be reflected to all students of your school.
If not, the generated share link can now be inputted in Subjective to retrieve your school's timetable and bell time data.
